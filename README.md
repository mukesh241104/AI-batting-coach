Watches a cricket shot video
– You record a small clip of a batsman playing a shot.

Breaks it into frames
– The video is split into images so the AI can analyze each movement.

Analyzes the shot using AI
– A deep learning model (3D CNN) understands the action happening over time.

Predicts the shot type
– It tells if the shot is a cover drive, pull shot, sweep, etc.

Works on any new video
– You can test any cricket shot video and it will classify it instantly.

Gives suggestions like a coach

👉 “Footwork needs improvement”
👉 “Shot mistimed”
👉 “Try moving your front foot forward more”
